After ascending to Aeonhood, Nanook ignited their home world.Despite being the most recently ascended Aeon, Nanook and their minions may already be considered the greatest menace in all the cosmos.",
      Appearancepath: "Nanook often appear as a human male that has long. white hair with brown skin and golden eyes. A giant scar, along with multiple scars. is seen on their chest as golden liquid seeps out, we can see that a quarter of his arms are floating, and that half his lower body is golden flames and black smoke, indicating his path of destruction.",
      DevLog1: "...Frankly, I still don't understand why Nanook the Destruction was born. Terminus the Finality was already traversing the universe before Nanook appeared. Is the Destruction not included in the Finality? We know so little about the secrets of the Paths. From the example of Xipe and Ena, we know that Paths with similar concepts can collide with each other, such as the Order being included in the Harmony resulting in Xipe absorbing Ena when the former ascended — It feels rather like survival of the fittest. However, there are examples of similar Paths co-existing for different lengths of time, such as the Preservation with the Remembrance and the Abundance with the Propagation. I guess perhaps our mortal conclusions about the Paths are still not at a high enough level. The true meaning of a Path cannot be completely expressed with just one word, or perhaps there are even deeper secrets regarding the Paths and the Aeons...",
      DevLog2: "...Nanook came from a star system called Adlivun, which has now been destroyed. The birth of an Aeon was often accompanied by an anomaly that shook the universe, and Nanook had probably ignited their own home. I got some information from the Astral Express on how Adlivun used to be. It was a tragic world completely marred by the Emperor's War, and was unfortunate enough to be on the path of the Swarm's march. When Akivili arrived there, Adlivun was still fighting a tense and endless war with the remaining descendants of the Imperator Insectorum. What kind of an Aeon would such a planet create? It is therefore not hard to imagine its eventual fate...",

      Appearancepath: "Qlipoth is a legless humanoid made of rocks and minerals with a halo behind their head.",
      DevLog1: "...Qlipoth the Preservation is the oldest known Aeon in the universe alongside Oroboros the Voracity. I was once very interested in Qlipoth, as the first two centuries in the Amber Era were almost completely blank. What creature is this giant rock/amber? Where did they come from? How did they become an Aeon? And why are they tirelessly making a wall? There are many questions surrounding them, but the answers are nowhere to be found. The IPC is doing too good of a job keeping Qlipoth's information a secret. These people regard the Amber Lord as the one true god and allow not even the smallest transgression towards the Aeon. I didn't get any useful information out of the IPC. In contrast, the Intelligentsia Guild has a lot less respect for the Preservation...",
      DevLog2: "...I don't respect the Intelligentsia Guild, but I like them. They are also followers of the Erudition but have none of the arrogance and temper of the Genius Society members. They are also down-to-earth and answer honestly when asked. According to Cleo the editor, the period between AE 0 and 180 was not as much a blank as the IPC had claimed. Many archeological discoveries proved that Leviathans were still active in the early days after the Preservation ascended, which goes against the IPC's official line that the Dusk Wars ended with the birth of the Amber Lord. There is even a hypothesis that other Aeons already existed before Qlipoth did... I can tell that the IPC won't fund such research from a mile off. Using threats to withdraw funding, the IPC coerced the Astral Ecology School to give up on these archeological projects, and that's why I'm no longer interested in Qlipoth. The IPC is just too annoying...",

Anyone with the slightest respect for the universe wouldn't apply our narrow definitions of good and evil to incomprehensible existences such as Aeons.
